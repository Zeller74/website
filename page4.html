  <div id="content"><p>I know I'm not the only person who despises this hero. I'm Masters, and I have friends who are similarly Masters. Hell, I even see pros like Mendo and IDDQD and clockwork who just resign themselves to the fact that Roadhog is indeed a hero in the game and that he does indeed have two ways of instagibbing a 200 hp hero - a 6 second free kill combo and a right click that can be mastered in a few minutes.
  He's a tank buster, he's a DPS, he's everything you'd want in a hero. He sustains himself, he kills anything in his line of sight. The worst part is the hero takes considerably less skill than, say, a McCree. And he has double, triple, quadruple the kill potential with a fraction of the effort required.
  I've seen so many awful players rank up based off the fact they only play Roadhog. He grabs one pick, the game state changes dramatically. And all he did was aim in the general direction of a squishy, press shift, and get a free kill. And if he misses, he waits six seconds to do it again.
  I've been downvoted every time I say Roadhog is an awful hero concept who should not be in the game. At the very least, make it so you can attack while being dragged to him so McCree has a way out or Reaper can escape. His hook's on a six fucking second cooldown, what more do you need?</p>
